						<summary>Object Detection for PASCAL VOC Challenge</summary>
						<p>
						Under the direction of Professor Tony X. Han, I was the key personnel of the MU object detection
team for the PASCAL VOC challenge. We ranked 7th worldwide. In our team, I was in charge
of:
1.HOG-LBP feature extraction;
2.Deformable model training using latent SVM;
3.Post-processing through context re-scoring to boost the final performance.

						<summary>Action Recognition Using Bag of HOG Variations</summary>
						<p>
						We developed a mid-level feature, Histogram of Oriented Gradient Variations(HOGV), for action
recognition with the bag-of-visual-words model. The HOGV feature is the temporal variation
of the stable HOG feature, which is not only stable due to its cell-block structure, but is also
capable of capturing the static and dynamic characteristics of human actions.

						<summary>Wireless Object Orientation Monitor System</summary>
						<p>
						We have successfully designed and built up a system to detect the orientation of any interested
						object. It could be combined with navigation system to guide vehicles. The system was composed
						by nodes and base station parts. The sensor nodes attached on the interested object collected
						orthogonal decomposed acceleration data alone lateral and vertical axis and transmitted them
						to base station. The base station was a computer connected with a microchip. While the job of
						microchip was to receive data, the work of computer was to calculate the orientation from the
						received data.

						Bridge Vibration Security System
						This innovative experiment project was leaded by me and supported by HFUT. In this project,we
						tried to estimate the bridge health by computing the vibration displacement. As the group
						leader, I took care of the whole system design, algorithm and software implementation. The
						designed system was assembled by sensor nodes and an base station. The sensor nodes controlled
						by microchip took care of data collection and transmitted them to base station via wireless
						communication. While on base station, the status of bridge was analyzed and certain alert would
						be sent out if status is abnormal. This system is widely applicable.
